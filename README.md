# Mechanisms to Improve the Efficiency of Recreational Fishing

April 27, 2021 - Webinar [(Recording Available)](https://github.com/zandergordan/NAAFE-2021-Rec-Webinar/blob/main/webinar_recording.mp4)

Most recreational fisheries are managed with bag limits and seasons that are set based on information from prior years. These policies are usually applied uniformly, over a large set of heterogeneous anglers. Furthermore, regulations are typically fixed once the season is underway. The economic net benefits from recreational fishing can potentially be improved with more tailored and flexible management approaches.

This webinar will focus on efforts to develop and test management approaches that use  angler-specific information to create incentives for higher-value harvesting patterns. Specifically, we seek policies that can (1) improve the economic efficiency of existing recreational harvest, and (2) improve the information available and potential pathways for more efficient inter-sector allocation (e.g., between commercial and recreational sectors).

Format: The webinar will open with very brief welcoming remarks followed by an overview presentation by Josh Abbott. Subsequent presentations will be 15 minutes, followed by 5 minutes of questions. The webinar will conclude with a 30 minute panel discussion, including questions from the webinar participants.
